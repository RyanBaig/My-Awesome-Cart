# Vercel Deployment for Django Project

This is a sample repository demonstrating how to deploy a Django project on Vercel. By using Vercel, you can easily deploy your Django application and make it accessible on the web.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- A Django project ready for deployment.
- A Vercel account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).

## Deployment Steps

To deploy your Django project on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


`git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/vercel_deployment.git` 

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:


`cd vercel_deployment` 

3. Install the required dependencies:


`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

4. Update the Vercel configuration file (`vercel.json`) with your project settings. Modify the `"buildCommand"` and `"outputDirectory"` according to your Django project structure.
    
5. Login to Vercel CLI by running the following command and following the prompts:
    


`vercel login` 

6. Deploy your Django project by running the following command:


`vercel` 

7. Follow the instructions provided by Vercel CLI to configure your deployment settings, such as choosing a project name and deployment environment.
    
8. Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a unique URL where your Django project is accessible.
    

## Badges

You can use the following badges to showcase your Vercel deployment status:
